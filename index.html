<h1>DEMON SLAYER CHARACTER</h1>

<div class=c1><h2>Tanjiro</h2>
<p>Personality. Tanjiro shows traits such as virtue, generosity, honesty, and humbleness. He is gentle to a fault, preventing him from making decisive decisions but is later shown to be serious when he needs to be. In the face of danger, he is brave enough to fight a demon slayer unarmed.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<div class=c2><h2>Muchiro</h2>
<p>Personality. Muichiro seems to always be forgetting things and his mind is constantly wandering. He doesn't let his emotions control him and his actions are decided based on logic. However, before his twin brother died he had a much more caring personality, showing compassion and kindness.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<div class=c3><h2>Tengen</h2>
<p>Tengen is a very eccentric person, always wanting to be flashy and 'flamboyant'. He seems to be uncaring and forceful towards many people but, we can see that he is actually kind hearted. He tells his wives to prioritise their lives first, second innocent people, and lastly himself.</p>
